# Firecracker
Small game made in Godot, for a game jam, as an exercise.

## What's it about?

It is a minimalistic 2D fighting game where you control a swordsman and fight just a few waves of enemies.  

I really wanted to learn and apply techniques from [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com) book,  
so I was late with my game jam application but decided to "finish" the prototype anyways.

You can play the game [here](https://sebasfealunn.itch.io/firecracker) or download the repo and build the game in Godot 4.2.2.
